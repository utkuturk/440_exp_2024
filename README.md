# Class Experiments for LING 440 @ UMD, Fall 2024


Following O'Connor's thesis titled *Comparative illusions at the syntax-semantics interface*, students formed 4 groups and created data and experiments to test their ideas.

The main branch has the "pooled" form of the experiments. With the following between participant manipulation:

- Too
- Adjective
- Verb
- Quantifier

In the base experiment, participants are randomly sorted into one of the categories and are shown the conditions for that between-participant condition. We opted out not using this during the pilot because we were worried that we wouldn't get enough data for each condition.
